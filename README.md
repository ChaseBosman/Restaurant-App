# Restaurant App
 The purpose of this application is to give a restaurant waiter the ability to take orders, send orders, as well as check out customers with ease. This application communicates with an sqlite database to load menu items as well as store customer purchases.

Server is ran through in_progress_window.py and client is ran through table_select.window.py. table_select_window.py is utilized by the waiter while in_progress_window.py is utilized by the kitchen/bar. The server file - "in_progress_window.py" needs to be executed prior to the client.
